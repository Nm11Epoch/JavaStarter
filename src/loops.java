// Things we learned:
// if and while statements have parentheses around their parameters
// if, while, and for loops all use {} instead of ";"
// in java, you say "else if" instead of "elif"
// all primitives can be compared using "==", but chars and Strings must use ".equals()"
// in java, you write "&&" instead of "and", and you write "||" instead of "or"
// 
// for loops are much different in java than in python:
// - you define an index value, state at what value it stops, and state how the index value changes at each iteration
// example: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i ++);
// This for loop would repeat 5 times - at that point the value of i would be greater than 5 and the loop would stop
