// Important things we learned:
// - all codespaces must begin with "public class ____", followed by "public static void main (String[] args);"
// - input in python is Scanner in java
// - all variables must have their type declared when created (int, String, double, etc.)
// - print statements are written as "System.out.print()" - println() moves to the next line once the print statement is completed
// - strings and variables can be combined in print statements just like in python, except non-string variables do not need to be placed in a str() typecast
